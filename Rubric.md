# Creative Project Rubric

So, our project idea is to build a questionaire site, where you can edit, share and get the result of your questionaire. The questionarie can be submitted through link or QR code, results can be displayed as a histogram, pie chart, etc. We will use Vue for frontend, Django for backend, and a MySQL database.
